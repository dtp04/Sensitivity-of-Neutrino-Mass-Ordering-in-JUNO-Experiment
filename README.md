# Sensitivity-of-Neutrino-Mass-Ordering-in-JUNO-Experiment

This repository includes the report and reference papers from the group project I completed with four other students at the 8th Vietnam School on Neutrinos.

**Objective**: Determine the neutrino mass ordering (normal vs. inverted hierarchy) by analyzing the energy spectrum of anti-electron neutrinos from nuclear reactors using the JUNO detector.

**Method**: Compare oscillation patterns, flux, and cross-section to determine the mass hierarchy.

**Chi-Square Analysis**: Evaluate the difference between normal and inverted hierarchy energy spectra using statistical methods.

**Comparison**: Insights are drawn by comparing JUNO with long-baseline experiments (NOvA, T2K, DUNE, Hyper-K).

**Neutrino Oscillation**: Analyze neutrino oscillation parameters and calculate survival probabilities.
**Spectrum Smearing**: Account for detector resolution effects.
**Sensitivity**: Predict JUNO's sensitivity to mass ordering over time.

**Languages**: Python
